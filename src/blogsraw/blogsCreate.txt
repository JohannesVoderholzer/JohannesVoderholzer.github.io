# How i created my personal website #

The website is written in html/css. I used no third party plugins like React or Angular. I only used #[name="Webpack website", text='webpack', link='https://webpack.js.org/', year='2023']# to compile nodejs into valid html/css code. 
</br></br>
The website consists of a main page, where some personal stuff is written and a dynamic blog. The dynamic blog uses #[name='firebase website', text='firebase', link='https://firebase.google.com/', year='2023']# for the "backend", which is very simple to use. Also it is free to some extend, so unless this website blows up i don't have to pay for it. I implemented a comment section for the blog from scratch, and also wrote a simple compiler for writing the blog. The compiler works similar to the markup language, where you can convert txt files to html code. I added some features that are not in markup, for example latex-like references and cooler code-snippets. I also implemented a simple page where users could in theory submit their own blogs, however i don't want to enable it yet since this kind of interaction between the database and the user is hard to secure. However, here is how this feature could look like in the future:

</br></br>

I was inspired to create my personal website to improve my software development skills and showcase my abilities for future job applications. I also wanted to create something cool and personal.
One of the challenges I faced while creating my website was ensuring its security. To address this, I used Firebase security rules.

I don’t have any specific plans for maintaining or updating my website. It should be able to maintain itself if I only have a few users, which is what I expect. However, I may need to do some bug fixing. To facilitate this, I implemented a simple user interface on the blog where users can send me a message if they find a bug. If I end up getting a lot of users for some reason, I may need to make changes to the database to handle more requests and potentially pay money to Google.
