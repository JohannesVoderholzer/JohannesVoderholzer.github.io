I have a simple language that allows me to write blogs in markup fashion. You have the following options:

1) You can add images in the following way (FILL IN WITH REAL IMAGE WHEN USING!!!!): #I[href="https://some/example/picture", caption="A cool image", size="100%"]I#
2) To add a header, you can use ยง some Header ยง, like in a markup file 
3) To add a code snippet, use the same notation as in a markup file
4) To add references, you can add something like this (FILL IN WITH REAL REFERENCES WHEN USING!!!!!!!!!!!): #[name='Example Reference', text='some text that uses the reference', authors='cool person 1 and cool person 2', link='https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test', year='2023']#. 
5) You can add bullet points like in a markup file, except that i use the following signs: 
$ numbered point
  ~ point 1
  ~ point 2
$ another numbered point
~ point 2

Now you task is to write a detailed blog with the following title: "Will AI destroy humanity someday?"

Please note that you have to use my proposed notation for references when you want to reference something you found on the internet. Use at least 2 references and 1 image
